I'm the CEO of [Saphirion AG][0] and inventor of [NLPP][1].

I have been working 15 years as a management consultant and interims manager (only doing it sometimes these days).

I like software development (but mostly pay others to do it).

I'm interested in a bunch of other things (surprised?).

I think out of the box. Trying to keep things simple. Always!
