Who is behind this website?

I'm working as a management consultant (sometimes these days).

I like software development (but mostly pay others to do it).

I'm interested in a bunch of other things (surprised?).

I think out of the box. Trying to keep things simple. Always!

**Simplicity is key to success, elegance and effectiveness.**
